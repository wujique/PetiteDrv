# Control Interface: C API's

- This document describes C API's provided for control path interface. Please refer [ctrl_api.h](../../host/control_lib/include/ctrl_api.h) for API definition
- [C Demo Application](c_demo.md) gives overview of how to test control path interface in application also how to perform stress testing of control path interface
- A [stress.c](../../host/linux/host_control/c_support/stress.c) can use for stress testing of control path commands. In which, `stress_test_count` variable represents the number of iterations the stress test should run for given configurations
- This document organized as
  - [1. Control path APIs](#1-control-path-apis)
    - These are APIs exposed by hosted control library
    - These are applicable for both MCU and MCP based solutions
	- Applications are free to choose how to use any API, in synchronous or asynchronous way
  - [2. Control path Events](#2-control-path-events)
  - [3. Function callbacks](#3-function-callbacks)
    - These are important structs used in case of asynchronous responses and events
  - [4. Data Structures](#4-data-structures)
    - Structures, which are used by the user application to interact with hosted control library
  - [5. Enumerations](#5-enumerations)
    - Enum values, which are used by the user application to interact with hosted control library

## 1. Control path APIs

### 1.1 int init_hosted_control_lib(void)

- This is the first thing that the application is expected to do before any other operations
- This function initializes hosted control library

#### Return

- 0 : `SUCCESS`
- -1 : `FAILURE`

---

### 1.2 int deinit_hosted_control_lib(void)

- This is a mandatory step, which will clean up the threads and any allocations made by the hosted control library

#### Return

- 0 : `SUCCESS`
- -1 : `FAILURE`

---

### 1.3 int set_event_callback(int event, [ctrl_event_cb_t](#32-typedef-int-ctrl_event_cb_t-ctrl_cmd_t-event) event_cb)

Applications can use this function to set event callback function for expected event

#### Parameters

- `int event` :
Event ID for control events from [AppMsgId_e](#58-enum-appmsgid_e-). Events supported are
  - ESP init : This indicates ESP has reset
  - Heartbeat : This indicates aliveness of ESP
  - station disconnected from AP : This active connection of ESP to AP _i.e._ external Wi-Fi router is lost
  - station disconnected from softAP : This means an external station, which was connected to ESP's softAP, has disconnected
- [ctrl_event_cb_t](#32-typedef-int-ctrl_event_cb_t-ctrl_cmd_t-event) `event_cb`
  - `Non-NULL` :
    - Callback function, which would be called by hosted control library when expected event received from ESP
    - This will start the notifications for `event`

## 2. Control path events
- Event are something that the application would subscribe to and get notification when some condition occurs. This way application doesnot have to poll for that condition
- Event subscribe
  - API [set_event_callback()](#13-int-set_event_callbackint-event-ctrl_event_cb_t-event_cb) is called with `event` and `callback function`
- Event unsubscribe
  - API [reset_event_callback()](#14-int-reset_event_callbackint-event) is called with `event`

### 2.1 ESP init
- When this subscribed, The application will be notified if ESP chipset is reset
- Generally when ESP reboots, it looses context set by host like connect to external AP, start softAP etc
- Host can make use of this event and re-do expected things
- This event also would let host know of any possible ESP silent crash. Please note, intentional ESP reboots also will trigger this event, so not all events of this kind are ESP crash

### 2.2 Heartbeat
- Application need to subscribe heartbeat event to get liveliness status of ESP
- Application need to configure heartbeat using API [config_heartbeat()](#122-ctrl_cmd_t-config_heartbeatctrl_cmd_t-req)
- This event notification will occur every duration seconds as mentioned in [config_heartbeat()](#122-ctrl_cmd_t-config_heartbeatctrl_cmd_t-req)
- Events are only notified if application subscribes this event **and** have configured heartbeat

### 2.3 Station disconnected from AP
- This event is useful to understand if any disconnection with external AP *i.e.* external Wi-Fi router
- Application can re-trigger station connect if the need be

### 2.4 Station disconnected from ESP SoftAP
- This event is useful to understand if any station disconnection with ESP softAP
- MAC address of station disconnecting is given to application

## 3. Function callbacks

### 3.1 typedef int (*ctrl_resp_cb_t) (ctrl_cmd_t * resp)

---

### 3.2  typedef int (*ctrl_event_cb_t) (ctrl_cmd_t * event)
This is the event callback pointer type. Application uses this type to set callback with event id
