Once everything is setup and host software and ESP firmware are loaded
* Verify that `ethsta0` and `ethap0` interfaces are seen on host using following command.
	```sh
	$ ifconfig -a
	```
* Verify that hci0 interface is present using below command
	```sh
	$ hciconfig
	```
* Proceed to section [3. ESP-Hosted Usage Guide](#3-esp-hosted-usage-guide) to test Wi-Fi and Bluetooth/BLE functionality.


# 2. ESP-Hosted Comprehensive Guide

Setup is required on two machines.
**First** to setup `ESP-Hosted Linux Host driver building` on Raspberry Pi
**Second** to create a development environment set-up on your native machine so that you can build the ESP-Hosted firmware and flash it on the ESP chipset.
The native machine here refers to your Windows/Linux/Mac desktop/laptop.
Although, if you prefer to use the released binaries for ESP firmware, second part of native machine setup can be skipped.

### 2.1 Linux Host: Development Environment Setup
* This section list downs environment setup and tools needed to make ESP-Hosted solution work with Linux based host.
* If you are using Raspberry-Pi as a Linux host, both [section 2.1.1](#211-raspberry-pi-specific-setup) and [section 2.1.2](#212-additional-setup) are applicable.
* If you are using other Linux platform, skip to [section 2.1.2](#212-additional-setup)

#### 2.1.1 Raspberry-Pi Specific Setup
This section identifies Raspberry-Pi specific setup requirements.

* Linux Kernel Setup
	* We recommend full version Raspberry Pi OS install on Raspberry-Pi to ensure easy driver compilation. 64bit OS is preferred, although 32bit OS is also supported.
	* Please make sure to use kernel version `v4.19` and above. Prior kernel versions may work, but are not tested.
	* Kernel headers are required for driver compilation. Please install them as:
	```sh
	$ sudo apt update
	$ sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers
	```
	* Verify that kernel headers are installed properly by running following command. Failure of this command indicates that kernel headers are not installed correctly. In such case, follow https://github.com/RPi-Distro/rpi-source and run `rpi-source` to get current kernel headers. Alternatively upgrade/downgrade kernel and reinstall kernel headers.
	```sh
	$ ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/  #Note the ending '/'
	```
* User previledges
	* Current user needs to be added to `bluetooth` group to use bluetoothctl without sudo
	```sh
	$ sudo usermod -G bluetooth -a $(whoami)
	```

* Additional Tools
	* Bluetooth Stack and utilities:
		```sh
		$ sudo apt install pi-bluetooth
		```
    * For throughput testing
		```sh
		$ sudo apt install iperf #for iperf2
		$ sudo apt install iperf3 #for iperf3
		```

#### 2.1.2 Additional Setup
* Linux Kernel setup on non Raspberry-Pi
	* Please make sure to use kernel version `v4.19` and above. Prior kernel versions may work, but are not tested.
	* Please install kernel headers as those are required for driver compilation.
	* Verify that kernel headers are installed properly by running following command. Failure of this command indicates that kernel headers are not installed correctly.
	```sh
	$ ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/  # Note the last '/'
	```

* Install following tools on Linux Host machine.
	* Git
	* Python 2.x or 3.x: We have tested ESP-Hosted solution with python 2.7.13 and 3.5.3
	* Bluetooth Stack and utilities:
	  :warning:`Note: ESP-Hosted related BR/EDR 4.2 and BLE 4.2 functionalities are tested with bluez 5.43+. Whereas BLE 5.0 functionalities are tested with bluez 5.45+.`
		* bluetooth
		* bluez
		* bluez-tools
		* rfkill
		* bluez-firmware
	* We suggest latest stable bluez version to be used. Any other bluetooth stack instead of bluez also could be used.

### 2.2 ESP-IDF Setup
- If you are going to use released firmware binaries, ESP-IDF setup is not required, please continue with `2.3 ESP-Hosted Code Repository` below.
- Follow steps hereon on your **native machine** (your Windows/Linux/Mac desktop/laptop)
- :warning: Following command is dangerous. It will revert all your local changes. Stash if need to keep them.
- Install the ESP-IDF using script
```sh
$ cd esp_hosted_fg/esp/esp_driver
$ cmake .
```
- Set-Up the build environment using
```sh
$ . ./esp-idf/export.sh
# Optionally, You can add alias for this command in ~/.bashrc for later use
```

### 2.3 ESP-Hosted Code Repository
Clone esp-hosted repository on Linux host.
```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules <url_of_esp_hosted_repository>
$ cd esp-hosted
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Please make sure that ESP and host checkeout to **same git commit**.

### 2.4 ESP-Hosted Setup and Load Project

ESP-Hosted solutions supports SDIO and SPI as transport for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth/BLE connectivity. Bluetooth/BLE connectivity is supported over UART as well. Follow below setup guides according to transport layer of your choice.

* [Wi-Fi and BT/BLE connectivity Setup over SDIO](SDIO_setup.md)

* [Wi-Fi and BT/BLE connectivity Setup over SPI](SPI_setup.md)
